I get an input for example 42.0f
I need to determine its type, so I will make it pass through all my isTypes
According to the value of i, I get the type.

Now, I have to convert it to its actual type, so I can just call the
appropriate function.

Then inside this function, I can convert it explicitly to the three other
types, from the type I just got.
